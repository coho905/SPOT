# SPOT
## SPeech tO Terminal (SPOT)
**Speak commands directly to your terminal**
<br />~~Remembering hundreds of terminal commands on various operating systems~~ -> Use natural language (and your voice) to execute command line instructions!

## How To Set Up
1. ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Get an OpenAI API key (and plug it in): <=$5 for a years amount the last I checked
3. ```bash
   python[3] main.py
   ```
## Usage


## Updates
1. Allow for text inputs instead of just voice
2. Customize reset and stop words
3. Look into huggingface API calls (free) instead of OpenAI (~$5 a year)
4. Allow for speaking instructions instead of typing
5. Enable forced execution
